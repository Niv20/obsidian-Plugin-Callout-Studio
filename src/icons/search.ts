/**
 * icons/search.ts — The shared icon search.
 *
 * One matcher for every source, so "arrow right" behaves the same whether the
 * pack spells its ids `arrow_right` (Material) or `arrow-right` (Octicons,
 * Font Awesome). Words are ANDed, which is what makes progressive typing
 * narrow the grid instead of scattering it.
 *
 * Matching decides *which* icons come back; ranking decides the order they come
 * back in, and the second half is not optional. Typing `home` into a library
 * that also holds `home-storage`, `smart-home` and forty others has to put
 * `home` itself first — in the index's own alphabetical order an exact hit
 * lands wherever the alphabet left it, which for Material is most of a page
 * down. Four tiers, in the order anyone reading them aloud would expect: the
 * name *is* the query, the name *starts with* it, the name *contains* it, and
 * last the entries that only answered through a label or a keyword.
 *
 * Ranking happens *within* one source, never across them. The pooled "All
 * sources" list heads each run of entries from one library with that library's
 * name, and `PackPanel.groupLabelFor` finds those headings by watching for the
 * source to change from one entry to the next — so a single global sort would
 * shatter six headings into hundreds. Ordering inside each run leaves the
 * grouping exactly as it was and still floats each library's best hit to the
 * top of its own section.
