/**
 * icons/packs/fontAwesome.ts — Font Awesome Free, all three styles.
 *
 * One source with a style control, not three sources. Solid, Regular and Brands
 * are one library to everyone who uses them, and splitting them meant three
 * rows in the source menu and three separate downloads for what is one decision.
 *
 * The style control filters the grid rather than just restyling it, which is
 * what makes one source workable: Regular holds 169 outline versions of Solid
 * icons and Brands 572 company marks with nothing in common with either, so
 * showing all 1,992 names under every style would leave most cells empty. Pick a
 * style and you see exactly the icons that style draws.
 *
 * Underneath, the three styles stay three pack files and three icon types —
 * `fa-solid`, `fa-regular`, `fa-brands`. That is what keeps every callout and
 * every cached drawing already out there working untouched, and it means a
 * chosen icon still carries its style with it.
 *
 * Licensing is the reason this file carries so much attribution detail. Font
 * Awesome's icons are CC BY 4.0, which requires visible credit and a note that
 * the work was modified — and it was: the path data is extracted from the
 * published SVGs and re-serialized, which drops the attribution comment those
 * files carry. Brands adds a trademark question the icon licence does not
 * cover, so selecting that style also raises a standing notice in the picker.
