/**
 * icons/packs/tabler.ts — Tabler Icons, both styles.
 *
 * One source with a style control, the same shape Font Awesome already has and
 * for the same reason: Outline and Filled are one library to everyone who uses
 * them, and splitting them would mean two rows in the source menu and two
 * decisions for what is one. Underneath they stay two pack files and two icon
 * types, so a chosen icon carries its style with it and cached drawings never
 * collide.
 *
 * The style control filters the grid as well as restyling it. Every one of the
 * 5,130 names has an outline drawing but only 1,054 have a filled one, so
 * showing all of them under Filled would leave four cells in five empty.
 *
 * This is the first stroked pack. Every other downloadable library is solid
 * artwork the renderer fills; Tabler's outlines are drawn with a stroke and
 * `fill="none"`, which is a paint the drawing has to state for itself. That
 * paint lives here, in source, rather than in the downloaded file — the file
 * stays path data and 1s, which is what lets it skip SVG sanitization
 * altogether. buildPackSvg emits it and renderIcon recognises it.
