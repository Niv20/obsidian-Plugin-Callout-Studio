/**
 * icons/lucideId.ts — Lucide's two spellings, and which one actually draws.
 *
 * `getIconIds()` hands back three different things under one list, and only the
 * first is spelled with a prefix:
 *
 * - Obsidian's own ~1900 Lucide icons, as `lucide-book`.
 * - Ids other plugins registered with `addIcon()`, bare — `remix-QuestionnaireFill`.
 * - ~44 icons internal to Obsidian, also bare — `dice`, `discord`, `help`.
 *
 * `getIcon()` reads that prefix as an instruction, not as decoration: seeing it,
 * it looks in the core Lucide table and **nowhere else**, while a bare id is
 * tried against the plugin table, the internal table, the deprecated-name
 * aliases and core Lucide in turn. A bare id therefore resolves through four
 * tables and a prefixed one through a single table — so `lucide-` prepended to
 * an id that isn't core Lucide names nothing at all.
 *
 * v2.7.0 prepended it to every bare value on the way into the registry, which is
 * exactly that mistake, and it is why this module exists. The rule it replaces
 * that with: **store whatever `getIconIds()` said, and normalize only when
 * comparing.** {@link canonicalIconValue} and {@link iconsEqual} are the
 * comparison side; {@link resolveLucideId} repairs a value that was already
 * written the other way.
