 * ViewPlugin's `wasMousedown`). The freeze holds our raw reveal back until the
 * mouse is released so it lands in the same paint as core's own — but a pill is
 * decoration of ours alone, with no core-owned syntax to wait for, so freezing
 * it buys nothing and can lose the reveal outright: if core's mousedown flag is
 * still set when the mouseup safety net fires, that rebuild reads the frozen
 * (pre-click) selection, and the transaction that eventually clears the flag is
 * not itself a rebuild trigger. The pill then stays shut until the next
 * keystroke — which is exactly "clicking a pill does nothing, arrow keys work".

 * This replaced walking `getLeavesOfType("markdown")` for `editor.cm`, which
 * only ever found the ONE top-level editor per markdown tab. Obsidian applies
 * a registered editor extension to every CM6 instance it builds, and several
 * of those are not workspace leaves: table cells and canvas cards in Live
 * Preview, an editable `![[note]]` transclusion, and this plugin's own
 * settings preview. Their inline callouts and heading callouts are widget DOM the icon sweep
 * deliberately will not touch (see CSS_CM_WIDGET), so missing them here left
 * them with no refresh path at all — they kept the old icon until the next
 * keystroke in that editor. GlobalStyleModal had already grown a local
 * workaround for its own preview; this removes the need for one.
