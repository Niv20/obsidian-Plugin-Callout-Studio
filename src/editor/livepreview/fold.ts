/**
 * editor/livepreview/fold.ts — heading-callout folding.
 *
 * The single fold path for every editor the in-bar fold arrow appears in:
 * real notes and the embedded settings preview alike. The section range comes
 * from `foldable()` of `@codemirror/language`, which queries the fold service
 * Obsidian registers for headings — so the arrow folds EXACTLY the range
 * Obsidian's own pre-heading fold arrow would fold.
 *
 * `@codemirror/language` is an esbuild external supplied by Obsidian at
 * runtime, so `foldable`/`foldEffect`/`foldedRanges` are the SAME service and
 * effect/field instances the native arrow uses: folds made here are
 * indistinguishable from native ones (persisted and restored the same way),
 * and reading `foldedRanges` reflects native-arrow folds too.
 *
 * The settings preview editor may lack Obsidian's fold service and even the
 * fold StateField. When `foldable()` returns null the range falls back to a
 * document-text scan, and if a dispatched fold effect is dropped because the
 * field is missing, `codeFolding()` is appended on demand; its parts are
 * module-level singletons, so re-adding is a deduped no-op in editors that
 * already fold.

 * Let the parser catch up with the viewport a fold just moved.

 * Obsidian's own Live Preview plugin — the one that hides `#` marks, list

 * decorations while the syntax tree stops short of the viewport:
 *
 *     syntaxTree(state).length < view.viewport.to || view.composing ||
 *         view.plugin(livePreviewState)?.mousedown
 *             ? this.decorations = this.decorations.map(update.changes)   // skip
 *             : (treeChanged || viewportChanged || selectionSet || …) && rebuild
 *
 * A fold or an unfold is exactly what pushes `viewport.to` past that frontier:
 * hiding a section means CodeMirror has to reach further down the document to
 * fill the same screen. So on a note big enough for Lezer's incremental parse to
 * be behind, toggling a heading leaves every plain `#### Title` that came into
 * view showing its raw hashes until the idle parse worker happens to catch up.
 * (Heading callouts never show this: their hashes are hidden by this plugin's
 * own CSS_HEADING_HIDE_MARKS, which has none of core's brakes.)
 *
 * Nudging the parser past the viewport ourselves ends it in the same frame:
 * forceParsing dispatches an empty transaction whenever the tree advances, and
 * a changed tree is precisely the trigger core rebuilds on. Time-boxed, and
 * gated on the condition core actually skips for — so a note whose tree already
 * covers the viewport (the common case) pays one field read and nothing else.
 *
 * Deferred by a task because `viewport` only reflects the fold after CodeMirror
 * has re-measured.
