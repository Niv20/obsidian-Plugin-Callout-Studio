/**
 * editor/livepreview/widgets.ts — CodeMirror widget for `[!id]` tokens.
 *
 * CalloutTokenWidget serves the inline callout, the in-heading token, and the
 * in-link ref token; its DOM comes from the shared builder
 * (renderShared.buildCalloutTokenDom), so Live Preview and reading view
 * render identically. CalloutContentPillWidget replaces a whole content pill
 * (`[!id]{…}`), payload included, which is what makes that pill a single
 * indivisible element. HeadingRefLinkWidget replaces a whole title-less
 * reference link (`[[#[!id]]]`) with a link-styled icon + display name.
 * HeadingFoldArrowWidget is a separate end-of-line chevron for heading
 * callouts (when the core "Fold heading" setting is on) that trails the title
 * text and toggles Obsidian's native heading fold for the section.
