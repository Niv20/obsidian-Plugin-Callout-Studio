/**
 * editor/livepreview/contentPillRender.ts — the `{…}` payload of a Live Preview
 * content pill, rendered as inline markdown.
 *
 * Reading view never needs this: by the time its post-processor runs, Obsidian
 * has already rendered the payload and the pill is built by MOVING those nodes
 * (see reading/calloutPostProcessor.ts). Live Preview has only the raw source,
 * because the whole `[!id]{…}` is replaced by one widget — which is precisely
 * what makes the pill a single indivisible element — so it has to produce the
 * same DOM itself. Both surfaces therefore end up with the same shape, and this
 * module exists to keep it that way.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing rather than incidental:
 *
 * - **The unwrap guard.** MarkdownRenderer always emits block content; a pill
 *   can only hold inline content. Anything that does not come back as exactly
 *   one `<p>` (`[!x]{- a}` parses as a list, `[!x]{# h}` as a heading) falls back
 *   to the literal text instead of injecting a block box into a line of prose.
 * - **The cache.** Live Preview rebuilds its decorations on every keystroke,
 *   every scroll and every selection move, and each rebuild constructs fresh
 *   widgets. Rendering is asynchronous, so without a cache every pill on screen
 *   would blank and refill one frame later, continuously. On a hit the payload
 *   is filled in synchronously inside toDOM, which is the normal case.
