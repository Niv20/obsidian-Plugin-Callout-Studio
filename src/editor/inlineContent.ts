/**
 * editor/inlineContent.ts — The `{…}` content grammar for inline callouts.
 *
 * An inline callout may carry a payload immediately after its closing bracket:
 *
 *     This is [!warning]{important text} inside a paragraph.
 *
 * The rules are deliberately narrow, because this syntax claims a character
 * (`{`) that ordinary prose uses freely, and a false positive would eat the
 * user's text:
 *
 * - The `{` must follow `]` with NO whitespace between them. `[!warning] {x}`
 *   is a plain pill followed by the literal text ` {x}`.
 * - Braces nest by depth, so `{a {b} c}` is one payload. The first `}` that
 *   returns the depth to zero closes it; anything after that is ordinary text.
 * - A `{` that never closes on the line is reported separately (`open`) rather
 *   than treated as "no content": the caller must still know a payload was
 *   started, so it can decline to render a pill while the user is mid-typing
 *   without changing what the token *counts* as (see LineCalloutToken.contentOpen).
 *
 * **There is no backslash escape.** `\{` and `\}` look like the obvious answer
 * and are actively wrong here: Markdown consumes the backslash before the
 * reading-view post-processor ever sees the text, so Live Preview (which reads
 * raw source) and reading view (which reads rendered text) would disagree about
 * where a payload ends. That divergence has no cheap fix — `getSectionInfo` is
 * null in embeds and during PDF export — so the escape hatch is inline code
 * instead: a brace inside backticks is blanked on BOTH surfaces by construction.

 * text the DOM-side walk skips — so a brace inside math must not count on the
 * Live Preview side either, or the two surfaces would close a payload at
 * different places. Deliberately not folded into `stripInlineCode`: widening
 * what the *token* scan ignores would change which `[!id]` tokens exist, and
 * that is settled behavior.
 *
 * Conservative by design: only single-`$` spans on one line, no `$` adjacent to
 * a digit (so "$5 and $10" is left alone), and an unclosed `$` matches nothing.
