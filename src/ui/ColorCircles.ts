 * too little room to *preview* one literally. Rendering a real gradient there
 * never reaches either end color (the eye only ever sees the blend's midpoint,
 * so two pale stops look exactly like a plain background). So the swatch encodes
 * a gradient instead, with the real colors but exaggerated geometry: it adds a
 * whole extra circle ({@link bgTo}).
