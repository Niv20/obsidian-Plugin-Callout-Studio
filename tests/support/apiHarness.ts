/**
 * tests/support/apiHarness.ts — shared scaffolding for the public-API suites.
 *
 * Not a `*.test.ts`, so `scripts/run-tests.mjs` never treats it as an entry
 * point; it is bundled into each suite that imports it.
 *
 * `CalloutStudioAPI` reads exactly two things off the plugin — `registry` and
 * `isKnownZeroUsageFallback` — so the "plugin" here is those two and a cast,
 * the same bargain `cssInjectorHarness.ts` and `discoveryHarness.ts` strike for
 * their own private surfaces. Importing the real `src/main` would drag the
 * whole plugin lifecycle into a suite that is about five methods.
 *
 * The one global it also needs is `activeDocument`. `getCalloutsDetailed()`
 * resolves `color` for whichever theme is on screen by reading
 * `activeDocument.body.classList`, and Node has no such global at all — so the
 * stub below is not replacing anything, it *is* the only document the code
 * under test ever sees. It is installed at module scope (`node --test` runs
 * each file in its own process, so it cannot leak between suites) and reset to
 * light by every {@link apiHarness} call, because a suite that forgot which
 * theme the previous test left behind would read colours off the wrong field.
