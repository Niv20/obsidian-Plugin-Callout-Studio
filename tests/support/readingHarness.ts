/**
 * tests/support/readingHarness.ts — scaffolding for the reading-view
 * post-processor suite.
 *
 * Not a `*.test.ts`, so `scripts/run-tests.mjs` never treats it as an entry
 * point; it is bundled into each suite that imports it.
 *
 * `createCalloutReadingPostProcessor` takes exactly two things: a rendered DOM
 * block, and a `MarkdownPostProcessorContext` whose only member it touches is
 * `getSectionInfo`. Both are modelled here and nothing else is.
 *
 * The section source is the interesting half. It is what makes the processor
 * refuse an escaped `\[!id]`, a `> # [!id]` line inside a callout, and a
 * `# [!id](url)` link — and it is deliberately *absent* in embeds and during PDF
 * export, which is a different code path rather than a degraded one. So
 * {@link ReadingHarness.run} takes it as an explicit argument: pass a string for
 * "this block's source", pass a full {@link SectionSource} to prove the
 * `lineStart`/`lineEnd` slice, and pass nothing at all for the no-source path.
 * Every call is counted, because "fetched at most once per block, and only when
 * a candidate makes it necessary" is a claim in the file's own header.
