/**
 * tests/support/localeTables.ts — every translation source, as data.
 *
 * `tests/locales.test.ts` reads the *generated* `locales/*.json`; this reads
 * the `src/i18n/*.ts` they are generated **from**. The distinction is the whole
 * reason this file exists: the JSON and the manifest are written by the same
 * run of `scripts/generate-locales.mjs`, so an edit to `he.ts` that was never
 * regenerated leaves the two agreeing with each other and disagreeing with the
 * source. Checking the source catches that edit in `npm test`, before CI's
 * `git diff --exit-code` does.
 *
 * The imports are spelled out one per line because esbuild resolves imports at
 * build time — there is no glob to expand, and the generator's `readdirSync`
 * trick needs esbuild itself, which cannot be bundled into a test. The cost of
 * that is a list that could silently fall behind `src/i18n/`, so
 * `tests/localeContent.test.ts` asserts these ids are exactly
 * `LOCALE_MANIFEST`'s: adding a 32nd language fails that test until it is
 * listed here, rather than quietly going untested.
 *
 * `en` is deliberately kept separate — it is the reference every other table is
 * measured against, not one of the things being measured.
