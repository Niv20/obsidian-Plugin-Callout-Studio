/**
 * tests/colorNames.test.ts — naming a color.
 *
 * `suggestColorName` used to match by raw RGB distance over a list that
 * included the gray/black/white anchors. RGB distance is dominated by
 * lightness, so those three swallowed every pale color: lavender came out
 * "Gray" and pastel pink came out "White". Importing a Callout Manager vault is
 * where that surfaced — a minted palette wears this name, so a callout colored
 * #c8a0ff was saved as "Gray 3".
 *
 * The two properties worth pinning down are opposites, and a fix that satisfies
 * only one is worse than no fix:
 *
 * - **Every anchor still names itself.** This is the regression guard on the
 *   HSL weights; hue alone would collapse brown onto orange, and a heavier
 *   lightness term would start collapsing the pale anchors onto each other.
 * - **A pale color is named for its hue.** The bug itself.
