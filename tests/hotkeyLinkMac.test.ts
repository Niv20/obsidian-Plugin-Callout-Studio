/**
 * tests/hotkeyLinkMac.test.ts — the same chords, on a Mac.
 *
 * `hotkeyLink` reproduces Obsidian's own formatting tables rather than
 * delegating to them, because the helper that owns them stringifies
 * `hotkeys[0]` and stops — a command bound to two shortcuts can only ever
 * report one through it. Duplicating them means they can drift, and the drift
 * is invisible on the machine the developer happens to be using: the whole
 * platform half of the table only ever runs on the other one.
 *
 * Two differences carry the file, and both are what a Mac user reads as the
 * shortcut being written wrong:
 *
 * - `Mod` means ⌘ here and Ctrl everywhere else. That is the entire point of
 *   the token, and it is the one place `Mod` and a literal `Ctrl` stop being
 *   indistinguishable in the output (see the Windows suite, where both print
 *   "Ctrl").
 * - macOS **stacks** the parts with a space, where every other platform spells
 *   the chord out with " + ". A `⌘ + ⇧ + K` is not how any Mac writes it.
 *
 * The joiner sits between *every* part, the key included, so a single-modifier
 * chord reads `⌘ K` rather than `⌘K` — pinned below because it is the kind of
 * detail a "tidy-up" would change without noticing it is the whole difference
 * between the two platforms' output.
 *
 * The tables are built once, at module scope, from `Platform.isMacOS` — right
 * for a plugin, since the platform cannot change under a running app, and the
 * reason this is a file of its own: the seam has to be set before `obsidian` is
 * even loaded, which only an import ordered ahead of everything can do, and
 * `node --test` gives each test file the process that makes that possible.
