/**
 * tests/embeddedEditorOwner.test.ts — the object the settings live preview
 * installs as `app.workspace.activeEditor`, and what teardown does with it.
 *
 * This suite exists because of a crash that carried no plugin frame at all:
 *
 *   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sourceMode')
 *       at e.updateViewState (app.js:1:1087153)
 *       at e._onFileOpen   (app.js:1:1086928)
 *
 * Clicking into the preview makes Obsidian assign the plugin's owner object to
 * `workspace.activeEditor` — its CodeMirror config carries
 * `domEventHandlers({focus(){ app.workspace.activeEditor = this.owner }})`.
 * The native menu-bar builder then runs on every `file-open` and
 * `active-leaf-change` and evaluates
 *
 *   !(mode === "preview") && activeEditor.editMode.sourceMode
 *
 * The owner answered `"source"`, so the `&&` never short-circuited and it
 * dereferenced an `editMode` the owner does not have. Nothing released the
 * registration either, so the dead owner stayed installed for the rest of the
 * session — the `activeEditor` setter ignores real `MarkdownView`s, so even
 * clicking back into a note could not displace it.
 *
 * Both halves are pinned below. The cases that are not marked as regressions
 * are the fence around them: they record the members earlier crashes proved
 * core dereferences (Word Count and the Command Palette on `editor`, RTL
 * scroll on `syncScroll`), so a future edit cannot quietly drop one.
